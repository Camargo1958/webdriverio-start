# WebdriverIO Test Project

This project uses WebdriverIO to run end-to-end tests on a web application.

## Getting Started

To run the tests, make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can do this by running:
npm install

To run the tests, use the following command:
npm run wdio
This will execute the tests specified in the wdio.conf.js file.

## Test Structure
The tests are organized into page objects, which encapsulate the functionality and selectors for specific pages. The page objects are located in the test/pageobjects directory.

login.page.js: Handles login functionality and selectors.
secure.page.js: Handles secure page functionality and selectors.
page.js: Base page object with common functionality.

# Test Scenarios
The tests are written in the test/specs directory. Currently, there is one test scenario:

test.e2e.js: Tests logging in with valid credentials and verifies the secure page is displayed.
